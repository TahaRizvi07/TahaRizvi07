- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Taha, a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, with a B.A. in Computer Science and two minors in Linguistics and Japanese. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web design and databases, as well as computational linguistics; although I haven't had what I would call *substantial* experience with any of these fields.
